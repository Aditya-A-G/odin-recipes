    <h1>Apple-Blueberry Cobbler</h1>
    <img src="../images/cobbler.png" alt="empty dish">

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This recipe was inspired by camping trips I used to take with my family when I was younger. Originally, this cobbler was made using huckleberries, and baked over a campfire; but since I no longer live in an area where I can get huckleberries and don't have a constant campfire going, I substituted frozen wild blueberries and baked it in the oven instead. I also use a homemade apple beer in the batter, but use whatever hard cider or fruity beer you like.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Gala apples - peeled, cored, and cut into 1/16-inch slices</li>
        <li>2 cups frozen wild blueberries</li>
        <li>⅓ cup maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
        </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch cast iron skillet.</li>
        <li>Mix apples, blueberries, maple syrup, cornstarch, lemon juice, cinnamon, kosher salt, and nutmeg together in a large bowl. Toss to thoroughly combine. Pour into the prepared skillet..</li>
